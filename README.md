# RL-Stock-Market-Bot 🏦📈  
A Reinforcement Learning-based stock market trading bot that uses a neural network to learn and determine the best trading policy.  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to trade stocks efficiently. It leverages deep learning models to identify the optimal trading policy using historical market data.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Utilizes a neural network to learn the best policy for trading.  
- **Custom Environment**: Designed to simulate real-world stock market conditions.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes scripts for importing and processing historical stock data.  
- **Automated Training and Weight Saving**: The best-performing model weights are saved and reloaded for future use.  
- **Google Colab Support**: A notebook is provided to run the model efficiently on cloud GPUs.  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `Agent/` - RL agent implementation  
- `Env/` - Custom trading environment  
- `Model/` - Neural network models  
- `Weights/` - Saved model weights for reuse  
- `Data/` - Historical stock data

- `README.md` - Project documentation  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Data Processing**: Import and preprocess stock market data.  
2. **Environment Setup**: Simulate trading conditions for training.  
3. **Training the Model**: Use RL algorithms to train an agent to buy/sell stocks.  
4. **Evaluating Performance**: Test the model using unseen data.  
5. **Deploying the Bot**: Use the trained model for real-time trading decisions.  

## 📌 Dependencies  
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow 
- NumPy  
- Pandas  

## 🛠️ Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/RL-Stock-Market-Bot.git
   cd RL-Stock-Market-Bot

## 📈 Results
The trained agent learns optimal trading strategies and adapts to market conditions by maximizing rewards based on historical data.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Implement different RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DDPG).
- Improve model performance with more features and fine-tuning.
- Integrate live trading capabilities.
